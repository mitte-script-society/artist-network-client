# Artist Connection Project (Frontend)

- Description
  - This is the React Frontend for our Artist Connection Project. The idea is that artists can sign up and be listed in a publicly available database. Users can then book artists in their town for a live concert.
  - We used Leaflet JS and OpenStreetMap for the visualization on a map and the Nominatim API for GeoCoding of addresses
  - A repository with the backend code can be found here: https://github.com/mitte-script-society/artist-network-server

- Instructions to run this app in my computer:
  - git clone
  - install dependencies (`npm install`)
  - create a `.env` file with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5005`
  - run the application (`npm run dev`)
